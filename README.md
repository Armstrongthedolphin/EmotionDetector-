# EmotionDetector-
Emotion Detector is a web app that mimics the style of the Messenger. Instead of sending a text with a blue background. Emotion Detector sends out a message with background associated with its positivity or Negativity. 
A positive message is represented by red color and the stronger the red color is, the more positive the message is. Negativity is represented by blue in the same fashion.
To detected emotion, we used textblob to d some NPL. TextBlob is a Python (2 and 3) library for processing textual data. It provides a simple API for diving into common natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, noun phrase extraction, sentiment analysis, classification, translation, and more.
We created this because we felt it would be a helpful tool for individuals who have trouble with understanding emotional signals through text. We also can see this technology leveraged to assist new English speakers to understand the gravity of some phrases!
